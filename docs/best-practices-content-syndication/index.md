As the [content syndication](/content-syndication-overview) feature executes external HTTP requests, there are implications if the feature is used excessively. You should consider the following guidelines when using content syndication:

### Occurrences

Limit the number of content syndication occurrences to three or less. More occurrences may impact an email job send speed or landing page response time.

### Caching

### Audience Size
