In AMPscript, a function is a named operation that takes input values (arguments) and produces an output. AMPscript uses a declarative approach through predefined functions oriented towards displaying, transforming, and storing customer data and marketing content.

AMPscript functions are pure functions: they take input and return output based on that input, making them independent and easy to reuse.
